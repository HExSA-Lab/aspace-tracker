This tool is used to detect write-after-read patterns for the 
zero page in linux. It will take a PID as its argument, and
will detect all zero pages in the process, and will delegate
a kernel module to track those zero pages. 

New memory allocations will also be tracked.

The idea here is that we get a time delta between when the zero
page was handed to the process and when the process actually wrote
to the page causing a promotion to a real physical page.
